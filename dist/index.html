        On her way she met a copy. The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that
        where it came from it would have been rewritten a thousand times and
        everything that was left from its origin would be the word "and" and the
        Little Blind Text should turn around and return to its own, safe
        country. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it
        with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which
        roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.
